# Claude Code Experiments

ü§ñ A repository for various programming experiments using Claude Code.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of experimental projects created with different programming languages and frameworks, leveraging Anthropic's Claude Code. Through interactive dialogue with an AI assistant, I explore efficient code generation and development processes.

## Projects

### üåê [my-website](./my-website/)
A modern website built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Features**: Responsive design, App Router

### üéÆ [rust-game](./rust-game/)
A terminal-based number guessing game implemented in Rust
- **Tech Stack**: Rust, colored, rand
- **Features**: Colorful UI, game statistics, difficulty hints

### üìä [language-benchmark](./language-benchmark/)
A benchmark tool comparing execution speeds of C++, Rust, and Python
- **Tech Stack**: C++, Rust, Python, matplotlib
- **Features**: Identical algorithm implementations, automated measurements, result visualization

### ‚òï [javafx-todo-app](./javafx-todo-app/)
A modern JavaFX todo list application with task management features
- **Tech Stack**: Java 17, JavaFX 21, Maven
- **Features**: Task CRUD operations, filtering, custom UI components, no Maven required (run.sh included)

## Experiment Objectives

1. **Multi-language Support**: Explore how to leverage Claude Code across various programming languages
2. **Efficient Development**: Rapid prototyping using AI assistance
3. **Best Practices**: Learn optimal implementation methods for each language/framework
4. **Creative Experimentation**: Try new ideas and technology combinations

## Usage

Each project contains its own README with detailed usage instructions. Please refer to the documentation within each directory.

```bash
# Clone the repository
